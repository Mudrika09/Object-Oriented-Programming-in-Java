
    We can’t create instance(interface can’t be instantiated) of interface but we can make reference of it that refers to the Object of its implementing class.

    A class can implement more than one interface.

    An interface can extends another interface or interfaces (more than one interface) .

    A class that implements interface must implements all the methods in interface.

    All the methods are public and abstract. And all the fields are public, static, and final.

    It is used to achieve multiple inheritance.

    It is used to achieve loose coupling.
